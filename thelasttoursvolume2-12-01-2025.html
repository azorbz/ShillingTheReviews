                    The Last Tours: Volume 2 is the follow up to the fabulous Volume 1 from October 2024. This time covering Elvis' March 1977 tour, six incomplete soundboards are covered over three discs. The set is a four panel digipak and the photos inside are quite nice. The discs themselves are simple RCA discs but do at least have the show dates on them.

                  <h3>
                    Disc 1 - 25th of March (Norman, Oklahoma)
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    You Gave Me A Mountain starts the recording of the 25th and immediately Elvis sounds muffled and there is a prominent hiss from the tape and crackle. Elvis doesn't seem to be putting in full effort. "My third movie was Jailhouse Rock", introduces Elvis before deciding to do Love Me first. Love Me is not much better being the typical crowd-pleaser. The backing vocalists are mixed far into the background somewhat ruining the effect of the song. Jailhouse Rock highlights how low in the mix Tony Brown's piano is. It is not a bad rendition compared to others I have heard  but isn't great. "Is it I-talian or It-alian?" Elvis asks before <b>O Sole Mio / It's Now Or Never</b>. Sherrill Nielsen does a decent job and Elvis gives his best performance thus far, even if he dos mumble a little at points, and the crowd loves it. "I know you've heard them before but you're going to hear them again" introduces the "oldies" starting with Little Sister. Again, it is a serviceable version but nothing special. Elvis' voice sounds weak during (Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear / Don't Be Cruel. Reading the lyrics to My Way ("in fact, I can't read it", Elvis giggles), Elvis gives the best performance so far. Despite a little mumbling, it is rather good, although better '77 versions can be found elsewhere. Fever takes us back to another average performance. Hurt is a lesser version than usual but the crowd love it nonetheless. Hound Dog is full of mumbling and not worthwhile. "I'd like to tell you that you're a fantastic audience, ladies and gentlemen, and that I think we're gonna be here tomorrow night. And so anytime you want us back, let us know and we'll come back." - Can't Help Falling In Love is one of the better performances of the night, but it is not great. Sadly, this is not a great start for this set. But fortunately things will pick up quickly.
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                    Disc 1 - 26th of March (Norman, Oklahoma)
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    "Just relax and enjoy the show", Elvis says before a significantly better performance of Love Me with better audio. There is significantly less tape hiss and no crackle in sight. Elvis seems to be enjoying himself, laughing at several points. Help Me is the first highlight of the show helping to showcase how much better Elvis sounds tonight. "If You Love Me (Let Me Know) and if you don't, well you know" - One of the biggest disappointements with Volume 1 for me was the lack of complete If You Love Me (Let Me Know); the version here is decent. "This song is called Lord This Time You Gave Me A Mountain" is sung much better than the night before and is rather great. "Let's do Love Me Tender or something like that so I can walk around" has Elvis laughing into the song. This is a typical crowd-pleasing version of the song, but it does have the amusing line change of "take me to your leader... heart!". "Let's do something up-tempo" has Elvis rejecting Jailhouse Rock ("not tonight") in favour of Blue Suede Shoes. Once again, Elvis is clearly in much better shape than the previous night with no mumbling to be found that was characteristic of the last show. "I will sta'n fronte a te", Elvis jokes to Sherrill during <b>O Sole Mio</b> before singing a good version of <b>It's Now Or Never</b>. "Hey, Mister Bass Singer. It's alright that you can't sing high; I can't sing low" takes us into Fever that isn't special. "I'd like to play guitar, ladies and gentlemen, and do a few songs beause I know three chords. You know four?" - That's Alright is a nice treat and is performed nicely. Are You Lonesome Tonight? has Elvis' voice wavering but I prefer it to the In Concert version. Elvis admits "I know it's a strange time" before Blue Christmas. It is another highlight and is sung very nicely. "I'd like to do a song that Frank Sinatra did. I think it's a great song" leads into another lovely version of My Way to finish off the disc. This show is substantially better than the previous. Clearly, FTD agrees having put no less than four multi-track recordings from this show on Spring Tours '77 (Blue Suede Shoes, That's Alright, Are You Lonesome Tonight?, and Blue Christmas). The only disappointment is that the ending of the show (Hound Dog, Hurt, and Can't Help Falling In Love) were not captured.

                  <h3>
                    Disc 2 - 27th of March (Abilene, Texas)
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The Abilene show starts a little bit into a well-performed You Gave Me A Mountain. Sadly, the prominent hiss is back but fortunately without the accompanying crackle on the show from the 25th. Elvis rushes through "don't you know you did, you gave me a mountain this...", but I do not mind it. "My third movie was Jailhouse Rock" and it is another good version. Elvis seems to be in a good mood and there is barely any mumbling on this number. I quite like this version of O Sole Mio by Sherrill and It's Now Or Never is also lovely. Elvis jokes around a little towards the end, but pulls it back together for the ending. "Let's do Blue Suede Shoes. We haven't done it since last night!", Elvis says before scrapping the idea and selecting Trying To Get To You instead. As much as I like Blue Suede Shoes, I am glad that Elvis made this decision and performs a great version. Playing guitar, That's Alright is next (along with a false start). I prefer the performance on disc one, but it is still a strong number, although the backing vocalists are mixed too low. As with the previous night, Elvis performs Are You Lonesome Tonight? (a "very serious song") next and it is even less serious. Still, Elvis sings well when he isn't joking. My Way follows, with Elvis again telling the audience that he needs to read the lyrics. Elvis talks most of the second verse, which I found rather effective. If the backing vocalists weren't so low in the mix, this would be one of my favourite recordings of the song and must have been a treat for the audience. It is certainly a highlight from the show, with Elvis even putting extra power into a truly impressive ending. "What do you wanna hear, folks?", Elvis asks before starting Fever. How Great Thou Art follows and is a wonderful performance (when isn't it?) although the quiet backing vocals let it down a little. The introductions follow (thankfully the only version on the set) and are brief due to Ronnie Tutt's drum solo, Battle Of New Orleans (Jerry Scheff), Tony Brown's piano solo, and Bobby Ogdin's electric piano being cut, despite having been recorded and featured on the FTD release Amarillo '77. Early Morning Rain is a delightful version and What I'd Say is decent (Charlie Hodge is not mixed high, unlike many soundboards). Elvis asks James Burton to play the guitar behind his head for a surprisingly spirited version of Johnny B. Goode. School Days is also fairly sprited for a song from the introductions. "One of my latest records is called Hurt, ladies and gentlemen" and is quite a good version. I would have loved for it to get a reprise tonight since Elvis is in good form, but this sadly doesn't happen. Hound Dog starts off pretty well but ends up being a typical version. <b>Lawdy, Miss Clawdy</b> was performed this night (between School Days and Hurt) and was recorded on multi-track as featured on Spring Tours '77. I understand why it was left out (presumably to keep it all from one source), but it is a good performance and it would have been nice to have here. In contrast, I'm largely unbothered by the lack of solos. Overall, this is my favourite show from this set with Elvis in great shape, even if the setlist isn't as unique as the show from the 29th. A contemporary review from the time in the Abilene Reporter titled "Coliseum Crowd 'All Shook Up' Over Elvis" comments on Elvis' good humour at the show and is in agreement about Elvis' performance.

                    "<i>It was a different Elvis Presley who returned to Taylor County Coliseum Sunday night after 2 1/2 years between shows. He was healthier looking; he seemed more relaxed; he acted happier; and he gave more of himself... his music? His voice? Sensational. As good as we've heard it, and with no trace of the fatigue which seemed somewhat evident when he last played here in October of 1974... ol' hip shakin' King Creole." Elvis... old love-me-tender, all-shook-up, don't-be-cruel Elvis, sounding like he'll never grow old.</i>"

                    Disc 2 - 28th of March (Austin, Texas)
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    "I love you too, honey, but I can't do anything about it" says Elvis before launching into Love Me. There is very little hiss tonight and the mix seems like an improvement over the previous show. It is a good version, but If You Love Me (Let Me Know) is great by comparison. There is nothing particular that stands out; it is just a well-performed version (with a good mix to compliment it). You Gave Me A Mountain doesn't reach the hights of the previous two versions, but still beats out the first version on this set. Jailhouse Rock is well-performed tonight with Elvis' enunciation much better than most versions. Elvis giggles in the middle and is clearly having a good time. "We'll do Love Me Tender later, just give me time", Elvis informs a fan before O Sole Mio / It's Now Or Never. The instrumentation is a little quiet here, excluding the trumpet, but it is (as has been said three times before) rather lovely. Elvis jokes about singing "Bigger Sister" later, leading into a good Little Sister, particularly on the last verse. (Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear / Don't Be Cruel is better than on the 25th, and Elvis jokes to the audience during the breakdown. Tonight, Elvis only claims to know two chords as he prepares for That's Alright. "My first record was called <b>That's Alright, Mama</b>". After the first verse, Elvis stops the song, joking that Charlie's arms are too short. The backing vocals are placed well in the mix, and it would be a great version if Elvis didn't halt the song again for accidentally starting to repeat a verse. Elvis resumes the song with the correct verse, singing "I broke a string now", and it remains a good version. I just wish that the song hadn't been interupted as it is enough to stop me from coming back to this version over others, but it remains a highlight. Steamroller Blues is next and is very special being Elvis' final performance of the song and happens to be rather good. The band performs excellently and Elvis seems to get into the mood. I am thankful that, unlike All Shook Up featured on Volume 1, Steamroller Blues gets a great final outing. It is easily one of my favourite songs on the set. It is no wonder why it was a bonus track on Amarillo '77 (along with the following song). Help Me is next and is rather good, although I prefer the version from the 26th. Elvis is in good voice for Hurt, although the ending is not quite as strong as the night before. Hound Dog is decent. "Take it home, son" takes us into Can't Help Falling In Love with the "wise men know, know when it's time to go" line. It is again decent version with Elvis at least doing the power ending. For the only time in the set, we get the closing vamp (no less than 30 seconds of it!). Steamroller Blues and That's Alright make this show a great one to return to (even if That's Alright isn't something I'd come back to on its own) and Elvis is again in fine form throughout.

                    Disc 3 - 29th of March (Alexandria, Louisiana)
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The 29th show begins missing the first few seconds of If You Love Me (Let Me Know). The instrumentation is a little quiet for my liking (and the vocals, at times), but the hiss again rather quiet. Disappointingly, Elvis does not seem to be either as energetic or as vocally great here, and the mix results in Elvis being burried a little at times. There is some feedback at the start of You Gave Me A Mountain and it is just an okay version, although it certainly improves getting into the second verse. The mix contributes to You Gave Me A Mountain sounding a little weak. With the usual statement about it being his third movie, Jailhouse Rock is next and is okay. At times, Elvis is very clear but other times he sounds muffled and mumbling. O Sole Mio is quite good from Sherrill. There is a loud popping noise at the start of It's Now Or Never (from Sherrill dropping the mic) which makes Elvis laugh and ask Sherrill to sing the song again. As is typical for this song, Elvis sings it well. The trumpets are very loud in the mix. Little Sister is a decent performance, perhaps lacking a little energy. After two false-starts, (Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear / Don't Be Cruel is again lacking energy and is rather uninteresting. Blue Suede Shoes is better before going back to the same level as before with Fever. Why Me Lord is a nice change of pace wit J.D. being rather loud in the mix. While Elvis leaves J.D. alone through the first verse, he jokes in the second verse leading to J.D. laughing and saying "God help me". The gospel music continues with the Stamps being called forward for Bosom Of Abraham / You Better Run and is another highlight for me. You Better Run would only be performed three times live with this being the final instance making this very special. Another gospel number is next: How Great Thou Art. Elvis' voice is not as strong as in the previous rendition but it is a good version nonetheless. This is followed up by Hound Dog which is slightly better than the other "oldies", except Little Sister. There is an extremely rushed thanks to the audience before an average Can't Help Falling In Love. A little portion of the closing vamp is included. This show isn't as good as the previous show, but the relatively unique setlist provides more reason to return than the show from the 25th. Outside of those unique songs, however, there is little of interest.
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                    Disc 3 - 30th of March (Alexandria, Louisiana)
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The final show in the set is also the final show of the tour (four more dates were scheduled but cancelled due to Elvis being checked into the hospital as a result of the intestinal flu). Love Me is fairly good, and the mix is definitely a step-up from the last show. If You Love Me (Let Me Know) is similarly pretty good despite some feedback. There is also feedback on the next song, You Gave Me A Mountain, causing Elvis to restart the song. The song is perforrmed decently but, like the version from the 29th, doesn't reach the hights of some of the others in the set. Elvis adds a little bite to one of the final "mountains", which is nice to hear. The Jailhouse Rock that follows is rather average. O Sole Mio and It's Now Or Never are great versions with Elvis putting varying power into his vocal to great effect like usual. Little Sister is good tonight while (Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear / Don't Be Cruel is just the average crowd-pleasing performance. And I Love You So features Elvis laughing and joking through the first portion, but it is a lovely version beyond the beginning first chorus (other than a slight wavering in his voice at times). Fever is good; despite not being a track that I particularly enjoy seeing in the setlist in the later years, I enjoyed this performance as did the audience. "Let's do Love Me Tender" is well-sung for a crowd-pleaser. Disappointingly, there is an audio dropout near the end but it quickly comes up to full volume. The backing vocalists are a little low in the mix which ruins the song a little. Hurt is next and Elvis puts quite a bit of force in select words making this a very pleasant version. Elvis' voice sounds like it gives out a little before a powerful ending - "Whoo!" indeed. By comparison, Hound Dog is bland and lacks any real effort (like most performances of the song) and is particularly weak tonight. The next song, Blue Suede Shoes, is an improvement (probably because in reality Elvis had a two song break as Sherrill Nielsen sang Danny Boy and Walk With Me). Can't Help Falling In Love has the "wise men know" line again. Elvis is quiet and even not singing at some points, leaving this set at a weak number. Elvis seems to attempt a power ending, but it doesn't sound right. There is some closing vamp tonight (36 seconds).

                  <h3>
                    Conclusion
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    To say that this set is a mixed-bag would be an understatement. While shows from the 25th, 29th, and 30th are barely worth returning to (although, as previously mentioned, the 29th does have the fun gospel section), the shows in the middle (26th, 27th, and 28th) are solid shows for 1977 and there is a lot to enjoy. In terms of highlights, there's Help Me, That's Alright and Blue Christmas from the 26th, My Way and How Great Thou Art from the 27th (Lawdy, Miss Clawdy would have been a highlight if featured), Steamroller Blues from the 28th, and Why Me Lord, Bosom Of Abraham / You Better Run from the 29th. In terms of mix and sound-quality, the set is rather inconsistent and certainly at a lower standard than Volume 1, although there isn't much that Follow That Dream's Jan Eliasson could do about that. Volume 1 also tends to have better setlists, with songs like <b>Where No One Stands Alone</b>, <b>Unchained Melody</b>, <b>Release Me</b>, <b>Moody Blue</b>, <b>Reconsider Baby</b>, <b>Polk Salad Annie</b>, and <b>Fairytale</b> absent from any of the shows in Volume 2.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The major disappointment from this set for me is the exclusion of Amarillo '77, which really should have been included, especially since the show previously released on Unchained Melody was included in Volume 1. Amarillo '77 is rarely available for under £70, and to have to purchase an additional set just to have a complete '77 soundboard collection is ridiculous when The Last Tours really should cover everything. It isn't a matter of space considering that Volume 1 had an additional disc for just one show (and it is suspected that the first show of the tour was also recorded on soundboard which could have filled up a fourth disc). I can forgive issues with the sound and the performances for this kind of comprehensive release, but not leaving out essential material (the introductions are arguably not a part of that).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Still, there is a good amount to love and FTD have to be commended overall for making these '77 available to fans. If you're a fan of the year of '77, this is naturally a must-have release, but I wouldn't say it is true generally. If Amarillo '77 was included, I'd give this a 7.5/10, but its absense makes it hard to rate it so highly. As such, I'll give it a 7/10, but note that I am incredibly thankful to have this release in my collection.
