                    On the 14th of June, the new David Bowie boxset, Rock 'n' Roll Star!, covering the period immediately after Hunky Dory until the start of the famous 1972 tour released. The set contains 5 CDs, an audio-only Blu-Ray, a 112-page hard-cover book, and a replica of Bowie's notebook from the time.

                The first disc is a collection of demos, home rehersals, and three Arnold Corns tracks. The first track, So Long '60s was recorded during Bowie's trip to the US (most of the other San Francisco Hotel performances can be found on the previous set, Divine Symmetry) and is, in fact, an extremely early version of Moonage Daydream. This version of the song is very far from the one that ended up on the album. Hang On To Yourself's demo also dates to Bowie's US trip. The track, unlike most of the demos in the set, has been widely bootlegged and, while the audio quality is no better than these bootlegs, it is nice to have released in an official capacity. What follows are the only two previously released demos, Lady Stardust and Ziggy Stardust, both of which could be found on the Rykodisc reissue of The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars. The two next tracks are the most interesting demos to me. Star (AKA Stars) is an excellent demo with radically different verses than the final release (''If someone had the sense to hear me / If someone had the time to see'') and shows the song's potential from its very first recording. Soul Love, in contrast, is pretty much in its final form, with Bowie humming the melody. The demo adds a personal touch to the track that does nothing but add to its charm. The track also includes Bowie's notes for Mick Ronson for the arrangement of the track. Starman has two demos, the first of which is only an excerpt. The second adds an extra ''spacey'' sound that is missing from the other demo, but I do not think it really improves the track. Bowie's three Arnold Corns tracks follow, two of which were previously released (Moonage Daydream and Hang On To Yourself). The other, Looking For A Friend, has been widely bootlegged, but, as with the Hang On To Yourself demo, it finally being officially released is amazing. The track is one of my favourites of Bowie's entire career (the demo and BBC recording were highlights in Divine Symmetry). It is represented in this set three times, with this one being the ''Rough Mix'' (the 2022 Mix is featured on disc 5), and is my preferred version. The disc finishes off with three unheard rehersals at Bowie's then home, Haddon Hall. Due to the recording only being intended to be used as a reference for the musicians in the studio, the songs Ziggy Stardust, Holy Holy, and Soul Love were cut-off and are thus segued together. Sadly, Bowie's voice is low down in the balance of the audio, but the performances are all excellent. The rehersals of Star and Sweet Head are featured in their entirety. These three tracks are excellent surprises, but are not the most interesting part of the set.

                Disc 2 starts with Bowie's performance for Sounds Of The 70s from the 11th of January, released for the first time officially. The source is an off-air recording since the BBC wiped the tapes containing the original performance. This fact results in a substantial dip in audio quality (which is noted on the sleeve of the disc) from most of the other BBC performances (in my opinion worse than the BBC session featured on disc one of The Width Of A Circle); however, the performance itself is spectacular. The two most notabale tracks for me are Ziggy Stardust and Waiting For The Man which are both exceptional. Due to the BBC's erasure of the tapes, one track is missing, Hang On To Yourself, which is disappointing but not unexpected and not the fault of Parlophone. Luckily, the next BBC show, performed just one week later, is represented in its entirety (including Hang On To Yourself) in exceptional quality. The performance itself is, to me, slightly worse than the first show, but it is a better listening experience due to the quality. The disc finishes with the three broadcast performances Bowie did for the Old Grey Whistle Test. Unlike most of the tracks in this set, two of the three are from Hunky Dory which is a nice change of pace. Disc 2 does have one notable abscence: the other take of Oh! You Pretty Things. Take one is included in the set (as it is clearly labelled) and yet the other take is missing. This is not something that massively affects the set, but it does make the set less comprehensive (which a set of this magnitude and cost should be).

                Like disc 2, the third disc contains BBC performances. All of these match the audio quality of the second show of disc 2. Not much of this disc will be unfamiliar to those who bought Bowie At The Beeb (indeed, the only tracks not on Bowie At The Beeb are the 23.05.1972 performance of White Light / White Heat and the Top Of The Pops performance of Starman). Despite the fact that this disc is essentially all previously released, it needs to be here. Its inclusion means that all BBC sessions - up until Tin Machine - are finally officially released in their entirety (excluding a couple of lost tracks). This disc also includes the only performance of Rock 'n' Roll Suicide on the CD portion of the set. The highlight of this disc for me is the Top Of The Pops performance of Starman. The performance of this song is legendary and for good reason. The pre-recorded backing is exciting, and Bowie's live vocal is top-tier.

                Disc 4 contains B-sides and single versions, as well as five live tracks. Round And Round is a song I've never really liked (although The Motion Picture's version is rather good), but it obviously has to be here. The Supermen, Holy Holy, and Velvet Goldmine are all personal favourites (with the latter two being perfect examples of the beloved Ziggy sound). John, I'm Only Dancing is another excellent track, but does feel slightly underwhelming after the excellent single-mix of Starman (which is noted in the book). The final five tracks are from Bowie's performance at the Boston Music Hall. Four of the five tracks were included on the 30th anniversary edition of Aladdin Sane, with My Death being the only new track. The accompanying booklet explains that it is likely that the entire show was recorded and unfortunately lost. This is a real shame as most of these performances are excellent, especially Life On Mars?. The new track, My Death, is disappointing. It doesn't match the power of Bowie's performance of the same song at the final Ziggy show, and Bowie's - at times - slightly arhythmic vocals are a tad jarring. Regardless, it is a treat to have these performances available widely as they are certainly amongst some of the strongest of the individual tracks. The exclusion of Sweet Head from this disc does make sense, since it was never released as a single / B-side, however, because it does not appear on this disc, the previously released mix is relegated to Blu-Ray-only status.

                Combined with disc 1, disc 5 is perhaps the most appealing part of this set. The first track is the more complete instrumentation of Looking For A Friend that most commonly features on Arnold Corns bootlegs (with a new mix). The additional vocals and instrumentation don't add much to the track, and might actually hurt it, but I will love any version of this song. I'm particularly glad it is here since it is the version I am most acustommed to through bootlegs. What follows is something not ever explored in the previous sets: alternative takes. There are three alternative takes, the first of which is Hang On To Yourself. This version has unfinished lyrics and as a consequence feels incomplete, but it still manages to be an enjoyable listen (although not one I'm likely to frequently return to). Lady Stardust is the first take of the song, and according to Ken Scott may just be a guide vocal. Despite this, it is a great version of the song. At the end, you can hear Bowie saying to immediately go into another take. This other take would be the version that ended up on the album. My favourite of the three is Star (still known as Stars at this point). It features lyrics that neither match the demo nor the final version. Bowie's voice seems less energetic than in the final version, but it fits the song nicely. Barring some minor issues with the performance, this could have easily ended up on the final album. Shadow Man is an odd performance. There are a lot of effects on Bowie's voice (due to bleed and distortion) which I do not think fit the song. Overall, I think the demo is the superior version of this track (the Toy recording is also excellent). My opinion on this does not seem to align with most others, many of whom seem to consider this a lost gem. In contrast, and skipping ahead a little, It's Gonna Rain Again is fantastic. I was intruiged by the song ever since hearing a small snippet of  what I assume to be the Glastonbury performance of this song online. Bowie's vocals are slightly incoherent, partially as a result of an echo effect, but you don't really need to understand the song to have a good time. The song has been long-awaited by fans and to finally hear it is a joy. There are remixes of The Supermen, Holy Holy, Round And Round, Velvet Goldmine, and Sweet Head on this disc. The Supermen is not radically different from the version on disc 4, whereas Holy Holy removes the vocal effects from Bowie's voice - which is something I've wanted to hear for a long time. After hearing it, I appreciate the previously released version more, but both versions are excellent. Round And Round is an alternative mix (which is also the case for Holy Holy), meaning that it was made back during the sessions for the album, and similarly removes the effect on Bowie's voice (which was more annoying on this track). I do not think this is enough to save the track, but I do consider it an improvement over the mix on disc 4. Velvet Goldmine removes some of the harder elements of the original mix, but does't alter the track too much (I prefer the original). Sweet Head's remix is nothing special, but weirdly removes the line ''while you're down there'' (much too some fan's disappointment). Starman also gets a remix, using the prerecorded instrumentation from the Top Of The Pops. Looking For A Friend also gets its Ziggy sessions debut, and is an excellent version of the song which is not too disimilar to the Arnold Corns Rough Mix of the track (Bowie sings ''abusive'' instead of ''acoustic''). Two more outtakes are included, being the previously unknown (well, until Ken Scott mentioned it last year during some talks) Trident Studios version of John, I'm Only Dancing and the known but unheard I Can't Explain (rerecorded for Pinups). John, I'm Only Dancing has a radically different vocal, but is not anything special. On the other hand, I Can't Explain is phenomenal. The track is much faster has much more energy than the Pinups version and certainly does enough different to make me consider these two versions separate listening experiences. I can't decide which version I like more; all I know is that I love both. The final track on the CDs is the 2003 Instrumental Mix of Moonage Daydream. It is nothing new, but really highlights the abilities of the Spiders and is worth a listen. One thing worth noting is that the highly anticipated Only One Paper Left is not included in this set, but it isn't without good reason. According to the book, Only One Paper Left only ever made it to the instrumental phase, and so never had vocals. Whether or not that means it shouldn't be in the set is up for debate, but I can live without it.

                The Blu-Ray can be split into four sections. I will only discuss three (since the fourth is just repeats of some of the contents of the CDs). The first is the 2012 remaster of the album which is widely available and was featured in the Five Years boxset. The second is the 2003 5.1 Mix of the base album, including the bonus tracks The Supermen, Velvet Goldmine, and Sweet Head. The third is ''Waiting In The Sky'', this year's disappointing Record Store Day release, which is just an early tracklisting for the album (containing the only instance of Amsterdam in this set, which is the 2022 remaster). None of this is essential, but it is nice that the set contains at least one copy of the original album. Quite rightly, the Blu-Ray has been criticised for not containing the Dolby Atmos mix that is being released on a stand-alone Blu-Ray on the 10th of September. I can't really comment on the audio-quality of the Blu-Ray since I am not really familiar with the metrics of the audiophile community. The fact that the Blu-Ray is audio-only is a slight disappointment. The work was put in to restore the footage of Bowie's performance on the Old Grey Whistle Test (LINKED) (the results of which are questionable), and yet the footage is notably abscent from the Blu-Ray. Similarly, the official YouTube channel posted Bowie's Top Of The Pops performance (LINKED), the footage from which is also excluded. The reasoning for this is unclear to me, particularly as one of these is one of the most significant performances in Bowie's career. To be fair to the set, there is no precident for these sets to include video (neither Conversation Piece nor Divine Symmetry did), but the fact that this footage was posted but not put on the set is disappointing.

                I would be doing the set a disservice if I didn't talk about the packaging. The (highly reflective) slip-case features a photo of Bowie on the front, and has the text ''I could make a transformation as a rock 'n' roll star'' (not unlike the ''Magnificent Outrage'' on Divine Symmetry). Inside is a replica notebook containing handwritten lyrics for tracks like Its Gonna Rain Again and Five Years, early track-listings, musical notes, and even a sketch of what was presumably an early concept of the cover of the album. The notebook is great, but the real gem in this set's packaging is the expansive hard-cover book containing credits and additional context for the tracks included. There is a wealth of information contained in the book, with interviews with Ken Scott (producer), Bowie's ''plugger'' (who provides an interesting account of how Bowie got to be on the television), Mark Carr Pritchett (who sadly passed away the day before this set released), and atendee of Bowie's 1972 Ayelsbury performance which is often hailed as the first performance by Ziggy Stardust, as well as photographs of tape boxes, Bowie performing, and newspaper clippings. The book, in my opinion, is what justifies the high cost of this set, other than the music, as clearly a lot of care was put into it (despite a few minor errors) and makes an excellent companion piece for the album.

                Overall, this set is a delight from beginning to end. For any fan of Ziggy, this set will be the perfect purchase. Its high price is definitely offputting, but it is (mostly) justified. The only reasons this set does not get a 10/10 from me are those detailed above, but they're really only minor issues and I cannot recommend it more.
