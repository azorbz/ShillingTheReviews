                    Dixieland Delight is a 2CD Follow That Dream release from 2009 containing the soundboard recordings of the 31st of May matinee show and 1st of June evening show from Elvis' five-show stop at Huntsville in 1975. Upon first receiving this album, I was immediately struck by how classy the packaging was. From the cover to the disc design, I could have believed that this was from the main Sony / Legacy labels. Especially for 2009, the package obviously had a lot of effort put in; most FTDs from recent years don't look anywhere near as good. Along with the standard 6-panel digipak, there is a simple eight-page booklet (the first FTD to do so). While mainly just containing photos, there is a page dedicated to the historical significance of the shows included, which is wonderful. Strangely, this passage notes that, of the five shows in Huntsville, the evening show from the 31st is the best, yet tracks from this show are kept to three bonus tracks at the end of disc 1 (<b>Johnny B. Goode</b>, <b>Hound Dog</b>, and <b>I'm Leavin'</b> - more on these later). This is one of, if not the best-designed FTD releases in my collection.

                  <h3>
                    Disc 1 - 31st of May (Matinee) + 31st of May (Evening) (BONUS)
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Moving on to the music, the first CD is the 31st of May matinee show, and is a tad disappointing. Both discs start at <b>Love Me</b> (missing the first few songs from the show) but are complete from then on. Whilst it has a strong ending, this is a rather average performance (something you will see with many of these tracks). The mix of the show is pretty good for a soundboard, but a side-by-side comparison with the second disc shows that the mix, as well as the show itself, is weaker on disc one. <b>If You Love Me (Let Me Know)</b> is again decent. <b>Love Me Tender</b> is next - "I made it five or six years ago. That's all it was; it just seems longer" - is decent, but Elvis is clearly in a decent mood, jokingly mumbling part of the song. A fan very audibly expresses their love for Elvis in the middle of the song. Elvis jokes, "I love you too, honey. Just give me time to get up there... lots of time to get up there!". <b>All Shook Up</b> is also just decent. "Is there anything else you want while I'm over here?" Elvis asks to the audience's delight. Elvis follows up with "creeping crud" and "jungle rot" comments that were typical for 1975. <b>(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear / Don't Be Cruel</b> is a below-average version of this crowd-pleaser. "What do you want? To go to the bathroom?" he jokes during the Don't Be Cruel section. Going into <b>The Wonder Of You</b>, there is a false start with Elvis joking, "It's very difficult to sing and have water in mouth. An old Chinese proverb". Despite the false start and Elvis' voice sounding a little rough at times, this is a highlight of the show for me (as this song often is). Again, Elvis' voice sounds a little off to me on <b>Burning Love</b>, but it is a decent version, and the entire song is performed, unlike on disc two. Regardless, the audience loves it, and Elvis thanks them ("You're a good audience. Thank you very much."). What I'd Say is performed during the eight-minute introductions, but it is incredibly weak (at least Elvis sings here, unlike on <b>Johnny B. Goode</b> on disc two). After introducing his newest single, <b>T-R-O-U-B-L-E</b>, he starts to sing <b>Trouble</b> (originally recorded in 1958)! While sadly Elvis doesn't do the entire song ("I don't know the rest of it, so we'll do the next song"). Like at the Dallas show, Elvis seems to struggle with the lyrics, but it is a serviceable version nonetheless. <b>Hawaiian Wedding Song</b> is rather lovely, with Kathy Westmoreland's "I love you"s well-placed in the mix, and the audience is very receptive to the song. Elvis seems less enthused with <b>Let Me Be There</b> than on disc two. The second chorus, however, is sung passionately, and the song gets a reprise, unlike on disc two. On <b>An American Trilogy</b>, Elvis jokes "you are [in Dixie], I've told you" during the Stamps' section. Glenn Hardin's piano is high in the mix while the orchestra is relatively quiet. It is a pretty great performance of the song. The house lights come up and Elvis has a fun interaction with an audience member who supports Elvis' old school's rival football team. He continues joking, telling the audience that the reason they haven't been to this area often was because "I haven't really wanted to come over here that much". What follows is a fairly unimpressive version of <b>Funny How Time Slips Away</b>. Elvis changes the words to "feels like it was only... Moby Dick!", but this performance feels low-energy. In contrast, <b>Blue Suede Shoes</b> is relatively energetic and a nice addition to the setlist. <b>For The Good Times</b> is chosen next "because J.D. likes it" and is just another average version. <b>Little Darlin'</b> is a favourite of mine, so it is a shame that this version isn't very enjoyable (mainly due to the poor mix). The instruments sound like they fade into the background, which is extremely jarring, causing the opening "la la la la"s to sound peculiar. "You've been a fantastic audience, ladies and gentlemen, and it's really been a... Can I say something for just a minute, please? It's really a pleasure to be here in, uh, Huntsville. We haven't been here for a long time but, uh, to do five shows and everything is really fantastic and we really do appreciate it. So, until next time we see you, may God bless you and take care of yourselvef" takes us into the closer of <b>Can't Help Falling In Love</b>. This is once again just a decent version, but Elvis' sincere words make it easy to swallow, even if Elvis doesn't attempt the power ending. After a brief closing vamp, we move on to the bonus tracks. Frankly, the first two are completely unnecessary additions. While not bad performances, I doubt that people buying this FTD release are interested in even more versions of <b>Johnny B. Goode</b> or <b>Hound Dog</b>. In contrast, <b>I'm Leavin'</b> is exceptional. The song was a rarity for 1975, being the second of only four known performances from 1975 (after the closing night of Elvis' December 1975 run, he would never play the song again, making this the 3rd to last performance). It's so good that it almost makes up for the previous two bonus tracks being picked, but not good enough to make up for the rather average show overall.

                  <h3>
                    Disc 2 - 1st of June (Evening) + 1st of June (Matinee) (BONUS)
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Immediately, I prefer the sound of this show over the previous disc with Elvis' vocals placed at the front. Starting with a decent version of Love Me, Elvis sounds much more engaged. You get a real sense of the excitement in the building with female fans begging Elvis to come over to them. Elvis is more than happy to oblige, and asks Charlie Hodge for no less than three scarves to pass out. If You Love Me (Let Me Know) is one of my favourite live tracks and it is performed very well here. Moving on to Love Me Tender, Elvis seems to be more committed to this version than to many performances of the song from this period. This trend continues on with <b>All Shook Up</b> and <b>(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear / Don't Be Cruel</b> (excluding some brief laughter by Elvis during <b>All Shook Up</b>). That being said, they're still the crowd-pleasers and are not highlights of the show. There are two false-starts to <b>The Wonder Of You</b>, with the first being caused by Elvis having water in his mouth (he makes the same joke as on disc one) and  the second caused by Elvis forgetting the words. As always, the song is performed beautifully and is one of my favourites from this set (ignoring some minor feedback in the middle of the song). Elvis sadly decides to abandon <b>Burning Love</b> after forgetting the words ("Forget it. Start it again."). The Sweet Inspirations (?) try to give Elvis the words, but he responds with "I don't even want to do it anyway". This is a real disappointment, but Elvis performs a spirited <b>Polk Salad Annie</b> instead - "Whoo! Thank you very much". The introductions are shorter this evening, "only" lasting seven minutes compared to the eight on disc one. "You know what I can't do, baby?" takes us into <b>I Can't Stop Loving You</b>. I've heard better versions of this song, but it certainly is good. Elvis' voice sounds a little rough as he builds up to the power ending. This evening, Elvis seems slightly more confident with the words to <b>T-R-O-U-B-L-E</b> and is one of the better versions of this song I've heard. "Take it on!" Elvis shouts as the song finishes up. Introducing the next song as from "Aloha" (the legendary 1973 Aloha From Hawaii television special), <b>I'll Remember You</b> is next. Interestingly, Elvis adds some falsetto highs which is not typical for this song - I am rather fond of this performance. Elvis seems happy to perform <b>Let Me Be There</b>, adding some vocalisations and singing "Yeah, <b>Let Me Be There</b> in your morning..." in a way reminicent of the version on Recorded Live On Stage In Memphis from the year before and adding "All I ask you, lord lord, is <b>Let Me Be There</b>". Considering how much Elvis seemed to enjoy the song, he doesn't choose to do the reprise, instead asking J.D. Sumner and the Stamps to sing <b>Why Me Lord</b>. Particularly during the second verse, Elvis tries to crack J.D. ("Not enough, that's for sure", "Sing it J.D." in a high voice). After succeeding, he asks "What's the matter J.D.?". While not as serious as some of the other versions, it's quite a lovely performance and Elvis seems to agree, noting "That was very good". In <b>An American Trilogy</b>, Elvis starts with some odd pacing of his vocals before asking the Stamps "Where do you think you are? Germany?" regarding them wishing to be in Dixie. Hearing Elvis push the band on during the build-up to the first chorus is wonderful. <b>An American Trilogy</b> highlights the better mix for this show with everything sounding just right. The ending is fantastic and the audience is clearly appreciative. Speaking to a fan, Elvis says "Honey, you have been jumping through the whole show. I mean you haven't stopped.". There's a typical "creeping crud" joke just before moving into <b>Funny How Time Slips Away</b> during which Elvis adds a strange giggle after "ain't it funny". Elvis once again chooses to perform <b>Little Darlin'</b> this evening and thankfully the mix makes this performance much more pleasant - "I need you, hot damn". Elvis talks to band about how they're supposed to join in on the "Hoopa hoopa hoopa" section. Elvis takes the time to sincerely thank the audience saying that they've been one of the best the band has experienced - "If you want us back in Huntsville, let us know and we'll be back". <b>Can't Help Falling In Love</b> is a decent ending to the show. "Okay honey, I shall turn around" leads us into the first bonus track from the matinee show from the same day, <b>I Got A Woman / Amen</b>. This is another odd choice for a bonus track, although I don't mind it as much as <b>Johnny B. Goode</b> or <b>Hound Dog</b> and is performed pretty well - "My goodness, that woke me up". J.D.'s "dive bomb" ending gets a huge round of applause. Elvis is in agreement ("I ain't gonna do it no more. That's about the best he can do it") and thankfully doesn't ask for J.D. to do it for a second time. Asking Charlie's permission, Elvis chooses to do <b>Heartbreak Hotel</b> (laughing at forgetting the words just before starting). Whilst another crowd-pleaser (we really didn't need three - four if you count I Got A Woman - as bonus tracks) is unnecessary, this is another decent performance with Elvis joking "You'll be so sweaty you could die" at the end. "Do we know Please <b>Release Me</b>?"- the answer is yes. This is not an exceptional performance (not to suggest that it is bad), but it is a nice addition considering that it is not in either of the main shows featured. Featuring the Stamps, the real highlight of the bonus tracks is, of course, <b>How Great Thou Art</b>. The mix complements this beautiful performance. My only complaint would be that Elvis seems to slightly rush the "Oh my God, <b>How Great Thou Art</b>" portion, but it doesn't come close to ruining the performance. Just like disc one, this is a fantastic ending.

                    Conclusion
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    To be honest, the show on disc one is disappointing and sours my opinion of this release. If it kept the same design but was limited to just the second disc, I would do nothing but sing its praises. In every way, the second disc is a significant improvement over the first, and I think it is good enough to justify purchasing this set (I paid ~£40 for it second-hand, which is fairly cheap for this release today). The 1st of June show is just one of many great shows from this tour which took place between the 30th of May and the 10th of June, rivalling my favoruite, Another Saturday Night (Shreveport, evening show, 7th of June). As such, I have to give this release a seven and a half out of ten (if it was just the second disc, this would easily get a 9/10 rating from me).

                    For those interested, the other shows officially released from this tour are 6th of June in Dallas (Today Legacy edition), 7th of June in Shreveport (Another Saturday Night FTD), 9th of June in Jackson (Spirit Of Jackson FTD), and the 10th of June in Memphis (Hometown Shows FTD).
