                        The Mind Games EP is a preview of the upcoming Mind Games Ultimate Collection (12th of July) and contains four tracks taken from the upcoming set. It was released for Record Store Day 2024 and is available in two variants. The first is 180g black vinyl, and the other is luminous vinyl (which is what I picked up). There are no other differences between these releases, which I am very thankful for.

                        The first side starts with the Ultimate Mix of Mind Games, which was previously released on the Gimme Some Truth release a few years ago. The mix holds up well, being my preferred version of the song (over the original and 2002 mixes). The second track is the Ultimate Mix of a song written for Ringo Starr, I'm The Greatest. While this performance of I'm The Greatest was previously released in Anthology, it has been speed-corrected and remixed, sounding better than ever. I'm The Greatest is not one of Lennon's best songs, but it is incredibly fun, which is all that is needed. Side two opens with the Ultimate Mix of Aisumasen (I'm Sorry). This is my least favourite track on the release, but it is still great. The remix is once again an improvement over the original mix. The final song is Take 5 of You Are Here. At 10:54, it is over twice the length of the album version, but it doesn't outstay its welcome. You Are Here is such a relaxing song and is the perfect way to end the EP.

                        While the EP only has four tracks, it does its job perfectly; I couldn't be more excited for the upcoming Ultimate Collection. There is nothing to complain about on this EP, and that is why it deserves a perfect score.
