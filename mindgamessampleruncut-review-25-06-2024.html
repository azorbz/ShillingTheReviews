                    The track begins with John's Make Love Not War demo, which could previously be found on Anthology. Sadly, this demo is not available in the Ultimate Collection (well, not as audio...). It then cuts to the band in the studio, with John talking to the band about how the song should go, briefly singing "Some call it magic, the search for the grail, love is...", which I think sounds lovely. The track then goes through a partial take of the track, capped off by Yoko talking to the band. It then moves onto a final take, with the combination of instruments sounding very similar to the Elemental Mix. When John's vocals start to be double-tracked, it sounds amazing. Of all of the mixes in the set, I was the most excited for the Evolution Documentary, and this track more than justifies that excitement. This track is available on <a href="https://youtu.be/BmTf7ntwcYA?si=kU-u4zdPxhK5oMbX">YouTube</a>.

                    I'm The Greatest was previously on Anthology, but the new mix sounds much better. Not only is it speed-corrected when compared to the Anthology version, but it also feels much deeper (the original feels flat in comparison). In the Ultimate Collection, this track will be hidden, so it is great to have it in the open on this sampler. You can find this track on the Mind Games EP, or a preview on <a href="https://youtu.be/TNIIZJLhf-A?si=A2wU59fS2H6RVhgJ">YouTube</a>.

                    Unlike the original mix of this song, the Ultimate Mix is incredibly impactful. Every instrument sounds amazing, to the point of being difficult to pick a favourite. John's voice is at the core of the song, but it does not overshadow the instrumentation. I had never thought much of this song, but this new mix has altered my opinion greatly. You can find this track on the Mind Games EP, or a preview on <a href="https://youtu.be/uIQaWv0BCwg?si=Y9xD5R2Xhp04ZhBu">YouTube</a>.

                  <p>
                    This track is almost eleven minutes long, which I am mixed on. It remains enjoyable the whole time, but I prefer the length of the album version (indeed, the Ultimate Mix that can be listened to here is better). Just like the final version, it is a relaxed song, but I would argue it is more true for this outtake. I don't see much difference between this take and the final one except for the length. You can find this track on the Mind Games EP, or a preview on <a href="https://youtu.be/WouKyNbEmL0?si=zw35i_afTknn5pw3">YouTube</a>.

                  <p>
                    I was never a fan of Tight A$ on the original album. While this mix doesn't change my opinion of the track substantially, I did enjoy it more than I had expected. The mix achieves its goal of leaving the listener feeling as though they are in the studio, which deserves a lot of praise.

                  <p>
                    On the original album, this is by far my favourite song, and, given the quality of this mix, I do not expect this to change. The first thing I noticed was the acoustic guitar. In the original mix, it is fairly hidden, but here it is on prominent display. In my opinion, it drastically alters the sound of the song, which I am mixed about. Those who have the set claim that a similar change is made on the Ultimate Mix, which is turning out to be a rather controversial decision. John's voice seems much clearer in the sections with backing vocals, which is a nice change. As promised by the Elemental Mixes, the main drum is not included, but Rick Marotta's bongos remain. The lack of drums makes the song feel much more laid-back than the final version.

                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    This track is stripped down to just the pedal steel guitar (Sneaky Pete Kleinow) and organ (Ken Ascher) and is incredible. I am not typically a fan of the Elemental Mixes (particularly not the ones showcased for this collection), but this is an exception. The track is gentle and relaxing (even more so than the Meditation Mixes found on the Lumenate app) and would be easy music to fall asleep to. You can hear it on <a href="https://youtu.be/OVjNToUXE9E?si=4JZlkq8ouAlqC6qu">YouTube</a>.

                  <p>
                    The first few lines of John's vocal sound fragile before bursting into one of the most surprising tracks on the disc. Like Aisumasen, this is a track I've looked over for the longest time. John's voice is at the front of the mix, and it feels very personal. The bass really drives the song forward, but the piano is probably the most interesting instrument in the mix. This song, of those that we've heard so far, is the best example of the Elemental Mixes.
                  </p>
                  <h3 id="MeatCity">
                    Meat City (Evolution Documentary)
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The track begins with the home version of the song featured on Anthology. It then cuts rapidly into a studio version with a lot of energy, which John ends rather quickly. Another take is sustained and also full of energy. Then there is a surprise of the backing vocalists singing their parts amongst studio chatter, which is extremely fun. John also seems to have a lot of fun in the take-after ("who is that and why are they doing those strange... things...") which is always nice to hear. The drums on this final version are very impactful, and it sounds great.

                    The sampler has boosted my excitement for the Elemental Mixes in particular. Mind Games was the only example of these mixes available before this release, and, while it was great, I was still uncertain. Bring On The Lucie and particularly Out The Blue have proven that this new mix is a worthwhile inclusion on the set. Nothing here is bad, although the Raw Studio Mix of Tight A$ doesn't do much for me. Assuming the rest of the Ultimate Collection remains of the same quality, I think there is a lot to be excited for in the upcoming set that is just over two weeks away.

                    I won't go into depth regarding the content of the magazine itself, but it does make for an interesting read. For those who want to purchase the magazine, they can order it from <a href="https://shop.kelsey.co.uk/single-issue/uncut-magazine/340">Kelsey Media</a>. For how cheap the magazine is, I would say it is worth it for the sampler alone, but the bonus writing does help the sale for those slightly less interested.
