                    Ready, Set, Go! is the new Record Store Day release from David Bowie and contains the majority of Bowie's 8th of September, 2003 performance at Riverside Studios. Broadcast to 86 cinemas across 26 countries, was, at the time, the largest live interactive music satellite event. The show had Bowie and the band playing through the entire Reality album a week before its release along with some encores.

                    The album is available in two formats: 2lp and CD. Both contain an insert of a replica poster for the event. The lp version has the poster placed on a black background and with nothing on the reverse. The CD version has the poster taking up the entire space and is backed with information about the release. This information is featured on the sleeves that contain the discs of the 2lp version. As is the case for most of Bowie's recent RSD releases, the sleeves are paper rather than being lined. The CD is housed in the cardboard directly and I found it to be rather tight. For some reason, the CD is a gatefold (the image in which is on the second sleeve of the lp version) whilst the 2lp release is not, meaning that the two discs and poster are in one slot.

                    For longtime fans, the main bulk of this material may not be new, since the Reality tracks were previously featured on the video-only DVD in the Tour Edition of Reality; however, this release does mark the first official release of the tracks in audio form. The encores, on the other hand, have never been released (though they can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-yjhaVqgxk">YouTube</a>).

                    Reality is admittedly not one of my favourite Bowie albums (though it is far from bad), but I have always loved this show. In many ways, I prefer it to the original album (this is also true of the versions from A Reality Tour). Despite a few errors, like Bowie slightly mixing up the words on New Killer Star, these performances are powerful and excellently showcase the new material. The highlights from the main set for me are New Killer Star, Pablo Picasso, Looking For Water, Fall Dog Bombs The Moon, and Bring Me The Disco King. Bring Me The Disco King in particular contains beautiful vocals (along with Mike Garson's stunning keyboards) and may be my favourite track from this release.

                    The encores, as mentioned before, have never been released before and are where I take a slight issue with this release. At the show, Bowie performed seven songs for the encores. Whilst Hallo Spaceboy, Cactus, and Afraid are included here, four remain unreleased: Fantastic Voyage, Hang Onto Yourself, Modern Love, and a second New Killer Star. These were presumably left off to allow the release to stick to a 2lp / 1CD format, but it is disappointing to me that this decision was made. I would happily have paid extra for 3lp / 2CD releases with the additional tracks. That being said, I do understand why this was decided upon so I am left a little mixed. What is included is pretty great. All three are wonderful performances, but I would choose Cactus as my favourite.

                    Ready, Set, Go! thankfully includes much of Bowie's interactions with the audience which shows Bowie in a great mood, making jokes ("This is my band and I'm in front of it; that makes me David Bowie!") and commenting on a few of the songs. Before hearing the release, I was concerned that this would be edited out as they sadly had on BBC Radio Theatre 2000.

                    There has been speculation that the final "era" boxset, following on from Brilliant Adventure, will be released this year. I had been almost certain that this show (along with a show from the Heathen Tour) would be included in this set as "box-bait". This release does pose some interesting questions: is this a hint at the box releasing this year and, if so, what will be the bait? I would have thought that if we were getting the era set this year, we would have had an announcement by now to allow room for an Aladdin Sane set later this year. I suppose only time will tell.

                    Compared with last year's disappointing Waiting In The Sky, this release is excellent. The performances are strong and the tracks were, until now, unreleased. The only complaint I have against this near-perfect release is that we are missing just a couple of tracks that would have made the show complete. I do hope that we will see the full show released on video in the near-future, but I suppose it should just be added to the list (Tower Theater '74, Buffalo War Memorial + Washington '74, Earl's Court '78, Hong Kong '83, Tokyo Dome '90, Birmingham '95, NYC '97, Paris '99, BBC Radio Theatre '00,... to name a few!). I recommend that every fan of the Reality album head to their local record store to pick up this great album. For those who want a taste the official YouTube channel uploaded <a href="https://youtu.be/sm337XcdmY4?si=nYR-GIh7hfmCIkLG">New Killer Star</a> from the show.
