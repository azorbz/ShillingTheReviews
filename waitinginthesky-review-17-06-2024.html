                  Waiting In The Sky is Parlophone's 2024 Bowie release for Record Store Day. While in previous years we've received new live albums, unheard EPs, and replica singles (although this was Decca, not Parlophone), this year we got what is essentially a compilation album of Ziggy-era tracks. Taken from the original 1/4" tapes from mid-December 1971, Waiting In The Sky presents a provisional track listing for what would become The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars. Due to its origin, only four tracks on this release are not found on the original album: Round And Round, Amsterdam, Holy Holy, and Velvet Goldmine. These tracks are not particularly hard to come by, with all four being found on Re:Call 1 (found in the Five Years boxset). Round And Round and Amsterdam have never been exceptional tracks, and they're not made better by the original context they were made in. Holy Holy (the Spiders version) and Velvet Goldmine, on the other hand, are great and could have easily been on the final album. Since the rest of the tracks are lifted off of Ziggy, they're amazing.

                        The ordering of the album is interesting. It opens exactly as the final version does, with Five Years leading into Soul Love leading into Moonage Daydream. Side one ends with Round And Round and Amsterdam. Round And Round's placement is fine, although Starman was the right choice for the final album. Amsterdam, on the other hand, feels out of place. It does not work with the rest of the tracks (certainly not as well as the Hunky Dory outtake that did make the final album, It Ain't Easy), and it does not work as the closing track of the side. Side two opens with Hang On To Yourself, which then goes into Ziggy Stardust, as it does on the final album, skipping over Lady Stardust and Star. I think this works well, although it does cause issues later. Velvet Goldmine and Holy Holy follow, carrying forward the energy of the previous tracks, which I like a lot. Star once again keeps up the momentum for the final track, Lady Stardust. Despite being a wonderful track, Lady Stardust does not have the same closing power that Rock 'n' Roll Suicide does, leaving the album feeling incomplete.

                        Since all but two of these tracks are great, you might be wondering why I've given this a pitiful 5/10 instead of something higher. The answer is simple: it is a waste of potential. Record Store Day has been the place where many of the best modern Bowie releases have come from, and so to have this compilation in place of something better is just disappointing. The disappointment is added to by the fact that I will almost never choose to listen to this over the better final version, making Waiting In The Sky just a collector's piece to sit on the shelf. With the added context of Rock 'n' Roll Star! (LP), which was released just a few months later, Waiting In The Sky becomes even less relevant. Between the finished album and Rock 'n' Roll Star!, all tracks on Waiting In The Sky, except Amsterdam, are represented (although the three outtakes are alternative mixes), and Rock 'n' Roll Star! offers a new experience, which is something Waiting In The Sky fails to provide. For those curious to try this album, just create a streaming playlist using the original album and the new Rock 'n' Roll Star! boxset (5CD) instead of shelling out £55+ on Discogs (which is shocking compared to the already high £27 I paid on release day).
